Alternative: two paired groups, interval/ratio not normal, Wilcoxon == Mann-Whitney U-test. Assumes independnece >=>

Count (on same span) <-> Feedback (binary) => Poisson regression
	total count per task

Percentage of Error <-> Feedback (binary)	
	actually it is: count/unitoftime

can we say that the % of error is a predictor of the Feedback


- Logistic regression is useful when you are predicting a binary outcome from a set of continuous predictor variables.
	anova(fit1,fit2, test="Chisq")

- Poisson regression is useful when predicting an outcome variable representing counts from a set of continuous predictor variables.

==> The difference in the Deviance and degrees of freedom of two nested models can be used in the likelihood ratio chi-square tests.

First, note that the Deviance has an approximate chi-square distribution with n-p degrees of freedom, where n is the number of observations and p is the number of predictor variables (including the intercept), and the expected value of a chi-square random variable is equal to the degrees of freedom. Then, if our model fits the data well, the ratio of the Deviance to DF, Value/DF, should be about one. Large ratio values may indicate model misspecification or an over-dispersed response variable; ratios less than one may also indicate model misspecification or an under-dispersed response variable.

- Poisson regression may also be appropriate for rate data, where the rate is a count of events divided by some measure of that unit's exposure
	Demographers may model death rates in geographic areas as the count of deaths divided by personâˆ’years. More generally, event rates can be calculated as events per unit time, which allows the observation window to vary for each unit. 

- logit is also central to the probabilistic Rasch model for measurement, which has applications in psychological and educational assessment, among other areas.

- Rasch models is a special case of item response theory and, more generally, a special case of a generalized linear model - 0 or 1 typically
